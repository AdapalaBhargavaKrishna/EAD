# Enterprise Application Development (EAD) Lab Repository

Welcome to the **Enterprise Application Development (EAD)** lab repository!  
This is where I'll store the files I create during labs.
(Even though I’ve already mastered Web Development, I’m still doing these labs as part of the curriculum as I'm a humble guy)
